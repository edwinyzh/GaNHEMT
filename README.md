## Abstract

> We present a self‐consistent numerical method for calculating the conduction‐band profile and subband structure of AlGaN/GaN single heterojunctions. The subband calculations take into account the piezoelectric and spontaneous polarization effect and the Hartree and exchange‐correlation interaction. We calculate the dependence of electron sheet concentration and subband energies on various structural parameters, such as the width and Al mole fraction of AlGaN, the density of donor impurities in AlGaN, and the density of acceptor impurities in GaN, as well as the electron temperature. The electron sheet concentration was sensitively dependent on the Al mole fraction and width of the AlGaN layer and the doping density of donor impurities in the AlGaN. The calculated results of electron sheet concentration as a function of the Al mole fraction are in excellent agreement with some experimental data available in the literature.
